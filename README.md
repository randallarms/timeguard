TimeGuard features the ability to record and display total played time on the server (after plugin installation). You can even set worlds to require a minimum number of played hours (x24 for days) to "/goto".

Commands:

/played
- Displays your total played time in chat.

/timeguard
-(add) (name) (hours) = Set world "name" to require "hours" of played time to /goto.

-(remove) (name) = Set world "name" to have no timeguard requirements.

-(vet) (add/remove) (player) = Adds or removes "veteran" status, which exempts players from timeguards

/goto <name>
- Teleports you to [x:0, z:0] @ world "name" if you meet the world's minimum required played hours.
