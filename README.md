Played time display & minimum required time for world entry; Bukkit on Minecraft (MCv1.11.2).

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/timeguard.191416/

TimeGuard features the ability to record and display total played time on the server (after plugin installation). You can even set worlds to require a minimum number of played hours (x24 for days) to enter, either through teleports or commands.

Commands:

/played
- Displays your total played time in chat.

/timeguard
- (add) (name) (hours) = Set world "name" to require "hours" of played time to enter.

- (remove) (name) = Set world "name" to have no timeguard requirements.

- (vet) (add/remove) (player) = Adds or removes "veteran" status, which exempts players from timeguards.

/goto <name>
- Built-in teleport; takes you to [x:0, z:0] @ world "name" if you meet the world's minimum requirements.

Plans:

- Add a customizable config file.
- Add different types of timeguards for other actions.
